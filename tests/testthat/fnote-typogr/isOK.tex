Business investment by private firms accounted for most of the increase in total investment in Australia after 2000.%
\footnote{Investment, or gross fixed capital formation (GFCF), can be grouped into two main areas: public (investment undertaken for or by governments), and private. Private investment comprises private business investment (investment undertaken by firms), ownership of dwellings (residential investment in houses, units and other buildings primarily designated as residences) and ownership transfer costs. Ownership transfer costs comprise the fees incurred during transferring ownership of real estate, such as legal fees and stamp duty; see \textcite{abs2015_SNA}.}
