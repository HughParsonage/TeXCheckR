I'd like an en dash - now.

Quotes need to be entered 'precisely'.

Footnotes can't have spaces before. \footnote{And should be full sentences}

We shouldn't refer to section 1 by typing out the literal cross-reference.

\section{Consitent labels are a good custom}\label{good-customs}

And English spacing dictates sentence spacing HERE. Otherwise the spacing looks strange.

Here the mismatched parentheses are obvious. (But it's not always the case.

We want to avoid this formatting: 10 million payments of $5 would total $50 million. 
And \LaTeX{} won't raise an error.
