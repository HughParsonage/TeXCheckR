The SSNP was a major initiative to improve the outcomes of low socio-economic students, with a range of different support programs in all states and territories.
For example, some programs invested in extra resources to attract the best leaders and teachers, others invested in teacher and school leader professional development.

Of the four evaluations cited, final evaluations are still to come given the impact of programs can take many years.}
